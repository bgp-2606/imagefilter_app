Description
__________________________________________
    Photo-Filter Editor allows users to implement a variety of filters to any image of their choice. 
The variety of currently available filters includes two-tone, three-tone, extreme contrast, tint sepia, 
posterize, edge detect, improved edge detect, vertical flip, and horizontal flip. Additional features 
consist of allowing the user to load any image, save a new image with their applied filters, quit the 
program at any point.


Installation
__________________________________________
    When installing Photo-Filter Editor Version1.0, the Python program must be installed as well as 
Pillow, which is an imaging library compatible with Python. The exact Python version for this program is 
Python 3.7.4.  Two files are also required to be downloaded. The Python module files necessary include 
Cimpl.py and L5_10_image_filters.py. L5_10_image_filters contains the filters previously mentioned.


Usage
__________________________________________
    To use the program, the user must first input the Load function by inputting an L to the program after 
the prompt appears. Each filterâ€™s consequent call varies from letters and numbers. The code runs regardless 
of whether the input is uppercase or lowercase. Filters are applied cumulatively. User can reset the image using
Reset command. The Save-as command prompts a dialogue box for the user to enter a filename.
